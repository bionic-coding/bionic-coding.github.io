# DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813

[Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19348)

## Introduction

**DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813** is the official release of **DeepSeek-V4-Pro**, superseding the preview version, with greatly enhanced agentic capabilities and performance improvements that are especially pronounced in production environments. It is built on the DeepSeek-V4-Pro (Preview) model structure, with a DSpark speculative decoding module attached.

DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813 outperforms DeepSeek-V4-Pro (Preview) on the benchmarks listed below, and is broadly competitive with the strongest proprietary models available.

| Benchmark | DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813 | DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 | DeepSeek-V4-Pro (Preview) | DeepSeek-V4-Flash (Preview) | GLM-5.2 | Kimi K3 | Opus-4.8 | Fable-5 (w/ fallback) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HLE (wo / w tools) | 42.7 / 60.0 | 37.8 / 51.5 | 37.7 / 48.2 | 34.8 / 45.1 | 40.5 / 54.7 | 43.5 / 56.0 | 49.8 / 57.9 | 53.3 / 63.0 |
| Terminal Bench 2.1 | 87.9 | 82.7 | 72.1 | 61.8 | 81.0 | 88.3 | 85.0 | 88.0 |
| NL2Repo | 61.5 | 54.2 | 38.5 | 39.4 | 48.9 | - | 69.7 | - |
| Cybergym | 83.3 | 76.7 | 52.7 | 38.7 | - | 80.0 | 78.3 | 83.1 |
| DeepSWE | 62.7 | 54.4 | 12.8 | 7.3 | 46.2 | 67.5 | 58.0 | 70.0 |
| Toolathlon-Verified | 74.1 | 70.3 | 55.9 | 49.7 | 59.9 | 76.5 | 76.2 | 77.9 |
| Agents' Last Exam | 25.7 | 25.2 | 16.5 | 15.8 | 23.8 | 27.6 | 25.7 | - |
| AutomationBench (Public) | 31.8 | 25.1 | 12.8 | 10.8 | 12.9 | 30.8 | 27.2 | 29.1 |
| DSBench-FullStack † | 71.1 | 68.7 | 41.8 | 37.0 | 61.8 | 73.7 | 71.6 | 77.2 |
| DSBench-Hard † | 67.2 | 59.6 | 31.1 | 25.8 | 54.5 | 63.0 | 71.7 | 68.3 |

Notes:

1. For the code-agent tasks among the public benchmarks above, DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813 is evaluated with the minimal mode of DeepSeek Harness as the agent framework, using the `max` reasoning effort level with `temperature = 1.0, top_p = 0.95`.
2. † DSBench-FullStack is an internal full-stack development test set; DSBench-Hard is an internal test set of difficult coding-agent problems.

## Chat Template

This release does not include a Jinja-format chat template. Instead, we provide a dedicated `encoding` folder with Python scripts and test cases demonstrating how to encode messages in OpenAI-compatible format into input strings for the model, and how to parse the model's text output. Please refer to the `encoding` folder for full documentation.

The `reasoning_effort` parameter now supports three levels — `low`, `high`, and `max` — which control how much deliberation the model spends before answering.

A brief example:

```python
from encoding_dsv4 import encode_messages, parse_message_from_completion_text

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I am DeepSeek.", "reasoning_content": "thinking..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "1+1=?"}
]

# messages -> string
prompt = encode_messages(messages, thinking_mode="thinking", reasoning_effort="max")

# string -> tokens
import transformers
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813")
tokens = tokenizer.encode(prompt)
```

## How to Run with vLLM

DSpark speculative decoding is enabled with a single flag — add --speculative-config with method: dspark to your vLLM launch command:

`--speculative-config '{"method":"dspark","num_speculative_tokens":7,"draft_sample_method":"greedy"}'`

For example, the command below serves the model with vLLM on a single 4×GB300 node. See the [vLLM recipe](https://recipes.vllm.ai/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro) for detailed instructions and other hardware configurations.

```bash
vllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813 \
  --trust-remote-code --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --block-size 256 \
  --data-parallel-size 4 --enable-expert-parallel \
  --moe-backend deep_gemm_mega_moe \
  --attention-config '{"use_fp4_indexer_cache": true}' \
  --speculative-config '{"method":"dspark","num_speculative_tokens":7,"draft_sample_method":"greedy"}'
```

## How to Run with SGLang

Enable DSpark with `--speculative-algorithm DSPARK` and do not set a separate `--speculative-draft-model-path` as the target and draft weights therefore come from the same checkpoint. See the [SGLang cookbook](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/DeepSeek/DeepSeek-V4#hw=gb300&variant=flash-official&quant=fp4&strategy=low-latency&nodes=single) for detailed instructions, benchmarks and other hardwares configurations.

```bash
sglang serve \
  --trust-remote-code \
  --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813 \
  --tp 4 \
  --moe-runner-backend flashinfer_mxfp4 \
  --speculative-algorithm DSPARK \
  --mem-fraction-static 0.90 \
  --chunked-prefill-size 4096 \
  --swa-full-tokens-ratio 0.1 \
```

## How to Run Locally

Please refer to the `inference` folder for detailed instructions on running DeepSeek-V4 locally, including model weight conversion and interactive chat demos.

For local deployment, we recommend setting the sampling parameters to `temperature = 1.0`, with `top_p = 0.95` for agentic scenarios and `top_p = 1.0` otherwise. For the `high` and `max` reasoning effort levels, we recommend a maximum output length of **384K** tokens.

## Capture gaps

- **`source_date: 2026-08-13` is inferred, not asserted.** The HF page shows no publication date. The date derives from the release-name suffix "-0813" and is corroborated by the Fireworks listing's "Created on 8/13/2026" ([[research/sources/deepseek-v4-pro-0813-fireworks-model-page]]).
- **All benchmark numbers are vendor-run claims** (DeepSeek Harness, `max` effort; footnotes above). The two DSBench rows are internal test sets nobody else can run. No independent verification happened.
- **Parameter count is not stated in prose** — only the HF page chrome ("Model size 1.7T params"). The active-parameter count per token is not on this page at all; the technical report (arXiv 2606.19348, uncaptured) is where that would live. The Fireworks listing says 1.6T — a 0.1T discrepancy between the two pages' spec fields.
- **Context length is not stated on this page** beyond the paper title's "Million-Token Context" and the 384K recommended output length. The Fireworks listing says 1040k.
- The arXiv technical report 2606.19348 itself is **not captured** — the obvious next ingest for architecture detail.
- HF navigation chrome, the "Use this model" library/inference-provider widgets, and the Transformers/vLLM/SGLang boilerplate install snippets were stripped; the model-card body and the serving commands that carry DSpark specifics are preserved verbatim.
