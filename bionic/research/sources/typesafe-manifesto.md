# Composable AI: Build Prod, Not God

our mission

### Our mission is to pave the shortest path to an AI-based economic
revolution[²](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix) by making intelligence composable to
catalyze a Cambrian explosion[³](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix) of intelligent
software.

We already have general intelligence

We're not racing towards the ever-moving goalposts of "AGI," because today's
models have long since crossed the threshold of intelligence needed for
creating massive economic value. They know an enormous amount, reason across
domains, and do things that looked impossible a few years ago.

Yet after years and trillions of dollars invested in the industry, most
software still isn't meaningfully intelligent, and life is mostly the same for
the average person. That should tell us something: the bottleneck isn't raw
intelligence. It's that today's intelligence is hard to build on.

beyond horseless carriages

Early cars were designed as horseless carriages: rather than reimagining
transportation from scratch, inventors took the familiar carriage and replaced
the horse with a motor, while keeping the high seats, the buggy springs, and
even the whip socket in some models. It’s a clear example of how new
technologies are often forced into the shape and assumptions of the thing they
replace before finding their own native form.

Current AI is trained to be a helpful, articulate, pleasant
assistant.[⁴](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix) Reasonable goals if you assume a human is
on the other side of the model. Yet the foreseeable consequence is AI that
requires humans in the loop instead of running in the background.

Software has never worked that way. Even the most complex software is built
out of simple logic and layered abstractions, with every branch auditable. We
want AI to work alongside existing software as a primitive that any programmer
can invoke for semantic judgement and decisions, while still using code for
what it’s best at: exact computation.

Computers can do so much by just branching on bits, imagine if they could also
branch on common sense, understanding, and intent.[⁵](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix)

This is the opportunity for true, machine-native composable AI.

safe emergence

The people who built databases didn't imagine Google. The people who built
internet protocols didn't envision Stripe. They made lower-level capabilities
so dependable that they could not only run in the background, but also be
layered on top of. A Cambrian explosion of software emerged that nobody could
have designed top-down.

Intelligence today is like databases before SQL: powerful, but every use is
bespoke. Once a smart decision becomes as dependable and invokable as a
database query, builders will stack them the same way. The intelligence
revolution will be like the early internet: unplanned, distributed grassroots
efforts built by builders for builders and owned by
all.[⁶](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix)

Safety is a precondition for layering. You let a component run unattended if
it's reliable; you only build on top of it if it's trustworthy. It takes trust
to bury a dependency five layers deep in a system. People will only do so if
they can inspect it, test it, and constrain it piece by piece, the way we've
always engineered dependable software. That's how the composable path enables
an ecosystem of small, legible primitives to safely evolve into trustworthy,
complex systems.

a new shape of intelligence

We're building the paradigm shift beyond AGI:

step one

### Ship the shape of machine-native composable AI[⁷](https://typesafe.ai/manifesto#appendix)
with the highest possible intelligence-per-dollar.

step two

### Make our AI reliable enough to transform the economy via real automation.

step three

### Empower the world with higher-level intelligence abstractions that are
stable enough to compose and layer upon, for a collaborative, emergent future.

appendix:

  1. Specifically, the lack of automation.

  2. There are many definitions of this, but our favorite is global TFP growth reaching 3% within five years and holding at that level for ten (unprecedented in economic history, but achievable if AI's gains diffuse across the real economy).

  3. Through creating the preconditions and allowing the world to take it from there.

  4. RLHF, the algorithm almost all of current AI is trained with, directly optimizes for human preference. Modern “reasoning” models are trained with RLVR as well, which optimizes for programmatically evaluatable tasks (i.e., benchmarks).

  5. This is the dream of neuro-symbolic AI: neural networks for perception paired with symbolic logic for reasoning. Sometimes cheekily summarized as “smart if-statements.”

  6. On top of rock solid infrastructure built by people who care A LOT. 🥹

  7. With a new type of frontier model meant for integrating AI within systems.
